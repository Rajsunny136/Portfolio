          <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Raju Anneboina</strong>, a passionate software
            developer with expertise in React, TypeScript, and the PERN stack
            (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). I love building scalable and
            user-friendly web applications that make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            With <strong>1+ years of experience</strong> in full-stack
            development, Iâ€™ve delivered projects ranging from enterprise
            solutions to creative personal endeavors. My goal is to blend
            technical skills with creativity to craft efficient and engaging
            digital experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest tech
            trends, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into a good
            book.
